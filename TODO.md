## Advanced search feature

- [ ] Can search by keywords/keyphrases for each line (bayang1, bayang2, maksud1, maksud2)

## Teroka page

Deploy along with new datasets (ideally ATMA's because it's large so a Teroka page would be helpful)

- [ ] Show a dashboard that shows the amount of pantuns associated with every tag (themes, languages etc.)
- [ ] Can explore the database using themes
- [ ] Can explore the database using language

## Enhancements

- [ ] Populate the homepage instead of navigating to a new page for the search results
- [ ] Test more designs to left-align the text in ModalPantun to make it more neat
